# FIBONACI_GENERATOR

Motivation

The motivation behind creating this Fibonacci Sequence Generator is to explore and implement a classic mathematical concept in computer programming. The Fibonacci sequence is a fundamental and intriguing sequence that appears in various fields, including mathematics, nature, and computer science. The primary motivations for this project are as follows:
This C# console application generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number using an iterative approach.

Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine:
Open the solution in your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

Build the solution to resolve dependencies.

Run the program.

Enter the desired number up to which you want to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

The program will display the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number.

Iterative Approach

The Fibonacci sequence is generated iteratively using a loop in this application. The program calculates each Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence.
