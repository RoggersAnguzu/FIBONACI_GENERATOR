# FIBONACI_GENERATOR
This C# console application generates Fibonacci numbers based on the user's input. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The program allows you to enter the range of Fibonacci numbers to be displayed.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Open the solution in your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

Build the solution to resolve dependencies.

Run the program.

You will be prompted to enter the range of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate.

Enter a positive integer as the range.

The program will display the Fibonacci numbers in the specified range.

The Fibonacci sequence will be printed in the console.

Once the numbers are displayed, the program will show a message indicating that the generation is complete.

How It Works
The program uses recursion to calculate each Fibonacci number in the range. It starts with the base cases of 0 and 1, and then recursively calculates each number as the sum of the two preceding ones.

Please note that recursive Fibonacci calculations can become inefficient for large ranges due to redundant calculations. For educational and small-scale purposes, this approach is suitable, but for more efficient Fibonacci generation, other methods such as memoization or iteration are recommended.
